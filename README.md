# Finite_element_method_application
Finite element method application used to calculate temperature distribution in an object

Whole program was written using C++. It reads all the important information about the object from .txt file and then calculates different matrixes 
and vectors for elements of the obiect's mesh. After that it aggregates them and calculates temperature distribution in this particular obiect. Results can then be
put into a program such as ParaView to visualise flow of the heat. I used it to show the difference in temperature distribution in normal brick and a brick used
for building furnaces.
